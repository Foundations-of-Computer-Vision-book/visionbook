# How to dev?
We need just two things. 

1. One-click install the dependency [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/); we really just need step-one for the `CLI`. (To test that the installation is all-good, The executable `quarto` should be callable from the terminal.)
   
2. Clone this repo. In the terminal, `cd` into the root folder of this repo. Run `quarto preview` and follow the prompt link (the link should look sth like `http:localhost:<some port number>`)
