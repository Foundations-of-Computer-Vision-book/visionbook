# How to dev locally?
We need just two things. 

1. One-click install the dependency [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (we really just need step-one on the page; to get the `CLI`). If the install goes right, the executable `quarto` should be callable from the terminal.
   
2. Clone this repo. In the terminal, `cd` into the root folder of this repo. Run `quarto preview`. If all goes well, a `localhost` link will pop up and a browser tab will open. That tab will be "live": i.e. it'd be updated as we make local changes.
