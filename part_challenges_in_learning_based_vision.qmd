\part{Challenges in Learning-Based Vision}
\reviewcomment{Summarize the content of this part.}

Learning-based vision comes with a unique set of challenges. This approach to vision derives rules from \textit{data}, and therefore requires tools for understanding where data can go wrong. This part of the book first presents several failure modes of data-driven methods, and then provides tools for mitigating these failures.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf{\Chap{\ref{chapter:bias_and_shift}}}} introduces the problem of dataset bias and distribution shift. We also encounter the issue of adversarial examples. These problems all come down to a gap between how the model is trained and how it will be used.

\item {\bf{\Chap{\ref{chapter:data_augmentation}}}} presents one way of dealing with this gap: train on a more diverse distribution of data.

\item {\bf{\Chap{\ref{chapter:transfer_learning}}}} presents a second way of dealing with the gap: adapt your models to bridge the gap.

\end{itemize}
